##Watch and analyze your bird's eating habits

###Aim 
Writing a database over multi week time frames. Timestamped entries are written by wild bird's setting off an metal
touch sensor.

###Required hardware hacks
Prolonging the metal sensor detection range is essential. I experimented a bit and found out its measurement quality
decreases using long cables.

TODO: directly attach the metal pin of the sensor to a polished part of the brass feeding pot.
